# Snake-Game
The Snake game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. The goal is to avoid running into it's own body and travel in the walls. In Python, the game is typically created using the Pygame library, which handles the game's graphics and input.
